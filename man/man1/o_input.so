.SS Input File Specifiers
Input files may be qualified in a number of ways: you may specify their
format and you may specify filters to apply to them.
An input file specification looks like this:
.RS
\fIfilename\fP [ \fIformat\fP ][ \fIfilter\fP \&... ]
.RE
.PP
The
.I filename
The filename may be specified as a file name,
or the special name ``-'' which is understood to mean the standard input.
.PP
The
.I format
is specified by the argument \fIafter\fP the file name.
The format defaults to Motorola S-Record if not specified.
The format specified are:
.TP 8n
\fB\-Binary\fP
This option says the file is a raw binary file, and should be read literally.
(May also be written \-Raw.)
.TP 8n
\fB\-Intel\fP
This option says to use the Intel hex format to read the file.
.TP 8n
\fB\-Motorola\fP
This option says to use the Motorola S-Record format to read the file.
(May also be written \-S-Record.)
.PP
You may specify zero or more \fIfilters\fP to be applied.
Filters are applied in the order given.
.TP 8n
\fB\-OFfset\fP \fInbytes\fP
This filter says to offset the addresses by the given number of bytes.
No data is lost, the addresses will wrap around in 32 bits, if necessary.

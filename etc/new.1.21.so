.\" pmiller, Tue Jun  7 23:54:56 2005, ignore-checksum option
There is a new \-ignore-checksum command line option.
The \-ignore-checksums option may be used to disable checksum
validation of input files, for those formats which have
checksums at all.  Note that trhe checksum values are still read
in and parsed (so it is still an error if they are missing) but
their values are not checked.

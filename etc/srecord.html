The \fISRecord\fP package is a collection of powerful tools for
manipulating EPROM load files.
.br
<p>
I wrote SRecord because when I was looking for programs to manipulate
EPROM load files, I could not find very many.  The ones that I could
find only did a few of the things I needed.  SRecord is written in C++
and polymorphism is used to provide the file format flexibility and
arbitrary filter chaining.  Adding more file formats and filters is
relatively simple.
.br
<p>
SRecord runs on almost any flavor of UNIX.  The source distribution is
self configuring using a GNU Autoconf generated configure script.
.br
<p align=center><b>The File Formats</b></p>
<p>
The SRecord package understands a number of file formats:
.br
<dl><dt>
Motorola S-Record
<dd>
The Motorola hexadecimal S-Record format is understood for both reading
and writing.
.br
<dt>
Intel
<dd>
The Intel hexadecimal format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Tektronix
<dd>
The Tektronix hexadecimal format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Binary
<dd>
Binary files can both be read and written.
.br
<dt>
C Array
<dd>
It is possible, for output only, to produce a C array definition containg
the data.  This can be usedful for embedding data into other programs.
</dl>
<p align=center><b>The Tools</b></p>
<p>
A number of tools are include in the SRecord package.
All of the tools understand all of the file formats, and all of the filters.
.br
<dl><dt>
srec_cat
<dd>
The <i>srec_cat</i> program may be used to catenate (join) EPROM load
files, or portions of EPROM load files, together.  Because it understands
all of the input and output formats, it can also be used to convert
files from one format to another.
.br
<dt>
srec_cmp
<dd>
The <i>srec_cmp</i> program may be use to compare EPROM load files,
or portions of EPROM load files, for equality.
.br
<dt>
srec_info
<dd>
The <i>srec_info</i> program may be use to print summary information
about EPROM load files.
</dl>
.br
<p align=center><b>The Filters</b></p>
<p>
The <i>SRecord</i> package is made more powerful by the concept of <i>input
filters</i>.  Wherever an input file may be specified, filters may also
be applied to that input file.  The following filters are available:
<dl><dt>
crop
<dd>
The <i>crop</i> filter may be used to isolate an input address range,
or ranges, and discard the rest.
.br
<dt>
exclude
<dd>
The <i>exclude</i> filter may be used to exclude an input address range,
or ranges, and keep the rest.
.br
<dt>
fill
<dd>
The <i>fill</i> filter may be used to fill holes in the data with a
given byte value.
.br
<dt>
length
<dd>
The <i>length</i> filter may be used to insert the data length into
the data.
.br
<dt>
offset
<dd>
The <i>offset</i> filter may be used to offset the address of data records,
both forwards and backwards.
<dt>
split
<dd>
The <i>split</i> filter may be used to split EPROM images for wide data
buses or other memory striping schemes.
<dt>
unsplit
<dd>
The <i>unsplit</i> filter may be used to
reverse the effects of the <i>split</i> filter.
</dl>
.br
<p>
More than one filter may be applied to each input file.
Different filters may be applied to each input file.
All filters may be applied to all file formats.
